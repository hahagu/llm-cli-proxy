# Code Standards

## General Principles

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid premature optimization; prioritize readability and maintainability
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, but don't over-abstract

## Vue/Nuxt Specific

- Use Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Prefer `ref` for primitives and `reactive` for objects when appropriate
- Use computed properties for derived state
- Extract reusable logic into composables
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use proper prop validation with TypeScript types
- Prefer template refs over direct DOM manipulation

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and composables
- Convex modules must use camelCase file names (no dashes); module paths may only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, or periods
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use kebab-case for file names (components, composables, utilities)
- Prefix composables with `use` (e.g., `useAuth`, `useApi`)
- Prefix utility functions with descriptive verbs (e.g., `formatDate`, `validateEmail`)

## File Organization

- One component per file
- Co-locate related files (component, styles, tests) when appropriate
- Group imports: external libraries, then internal modules, then types
- Export types and interfaces from dedicated type files when shared

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors appropriately
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging but don't expose sensitive information to users
- Use proper error boundaries in Vue components

## Performance

- Use `v-memo` for expensive list rendering when appropriate
- Lazy load components with `defineAsyncComponent` when beneficial
- Avoid unnecessary reactivity with `shallowRef` or `markRaw` when appropriate
- Use `v-once` for static content that never changes
- Debounce or throttle expensive operations (user input, API calls)

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide proper ARIA labels when needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Maintain proper focus management
- Test with screen readers when possible

## Comments and Documentation

- Write comments that explain "why", not "what"
- Use JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Remove commented-out code before committing
