# Project Rules

## Package Manager

- Always use `bun` or `bunx` as the package manager for all operations
- Never use npm, yarn, or pnpm commands
- When installing packages, use `bun add` or `bun add -d` for dev dependencies
- When running scripts, use `bun run` or `bunx` for one-off commands

## Documentation

- Use context7 MCP server for documentation on various libraries
- Always consult context7 documentation before implementing features with external libraries
- Make use of context7 documentation whenever possible to ensure best practices

## Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind v4 directives (@theme, @layer, etc.) for configuration
- Do NOT use or create a `tailwind.config.ts` file
- Configure Tailwind through CSS directives in the stylesheet
- Use Tailwind v4 syntax and features

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Nuxt v4
- **Styling**: Tailwind v4
- **UI Components**: Shadcn-vue
- **Backend**: Convex

## Path Aliases

- `~~` or `@@` refers to the project root directory
- `~` or `@` refers to the app folder (`app/`)
- Use `~~/convex` (or `@@/convex`) when importing from the convex directory
- Use `@/components`, `@/composables`, etc. for app-level imports
- Example imports:
  ```ts
  import { api } from "~~/convex/_generated/api";
  import { useAuth } from "@/composables/use-auth";
  ```

## Convex Organization

- Separate queries, mutations, and actions into separate files within feature directories
- Organize by feature/domain (e.g., `home/queries.ts`, `home/mutations.ts`, `home/actions.ts`)
- Each directory should contain only the relevant function type files
- Use descriptive directory names that reflect the domain or feature area
- Use the `"use node"` directive at the top of files when using Node.js functions in Convex
- Avoid creating `index.ts` files in directories
- Example structure:
  ```
  convex/
    home/
      queries.ts
      mutations.ts
      actions.ts
    users/
      queries.ts
      mutations.ts
      actions.ts
  ```

## Nuxt Auto-imports

- Always rely on Nuxt's auto-imports unless explicitly stated otherwise
- Do NOT explicitly import Nuxt composables and utilities (e.g., `useRouter`, `useRoute`, `useState`, `navigateTo`, `useFetch`, etc.)
- Use auto-imported functions directly without import statements
- Only add explicit imports when specifically requested or when using non-auto-imported features

## Component Development

- Use shadcn-vue components whenever creating reusable components
- If modifications to shadcn-vue components are necessary, create a variant instead of modifying the base component
- Follow shadcn-vue patterns and conventions
- Components should be placed in `app/components/ui/` following the existing structure

## TypeScript

- Always use strict types instead of `any`
- Prefer explicit type definitions
- Use proper type inference where appropriate

## Code Style

- Keep answers concise and direct
- Prioritize technical details over generic advice
- Follow existing code patterns in the repository
